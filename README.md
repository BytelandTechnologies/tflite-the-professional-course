# Welcome to TensorFlow Lite - The Professional Course's repository!

This repository contains the Android mobile apps developed for [TensorFlow Lite - The Professional Course](https://hotm.art/tflite_the_professional_course). Both apps run a compressed and optimized TensorFlow Lite model to classify images taken with the device's camera 100% at the edge, with no Internet connection. The first app classifies images of dogs, while the second classifies images of flowers. Both of them can serve as templates for any mobile application that relies on machine learning at the edge.

# Branches
This project is composed of the following branches:

 1. ***main***: keeps this documentation.
 2. ***dogs_classification***: holds the app that classifies images of dogs.
 3. ***flowers_classification***: contains the app that classifies images of flowers.
